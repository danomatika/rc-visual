a simple interpreter and renderer controlled over osc

Dan Wilcox <info@robotcowboy.com>

##### DESCRIPTION #####

##### BUILD REQUIREMENTS #####

The following libraries are required:
    - SDL
    - SDL_gfx
    - liblo (lightweight osc)
    - glib-2.0

On Max OS X, they can be installed using macports: http://macports.org
    - install the macport binary and setup the macports enviornment
    - goto the Terminal and install the libs:
        sudo port install libsdl libsdl_gfx liblo glib2

##### BUILD #####

As this is an GNU autotools project, simply run:

./configure
make

If using macports on Mac OS X, you need to set the macports include and lib dirs before running ./configure:

export CPPFLAGS=-I/opt/local/include && export LDFLAGS=-L/opt/local/lib

##### INSTALLATION #####

After a successful build, running the following command will install the project:

make install

By default, the configure script installs to /usr/local.  To change this behavior, specify a new dir before building the project:

./configure --prefix=/path/to/install/dir

If using macports on Mac OS X, it is recommended to use the macports default prefix of /opt/local.
